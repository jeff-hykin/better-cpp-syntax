:information_for_contributors:
- 'This code was auto generated by a much-more-readble ruby file: https://github.com/jeff-hykin/cpp-textmate-grammar/blob/master/generate.rb'
- It is a lot easier to modify the ruby file and have it generate the rest of the
  code
- Also the ruby source is very open to merge requests, so please make one if something
  could be improved
- This file essentially an updated/improved fork of the atom syntax https://github.com/atom/language-c/blob/master/grammars/c%2B%2B.cson
